== Description ==

# **ALL-IN-ONE SOLUTION**

#### As a user of WP GDPR you have two simple tasks:

# **TOP PRIORITY**

Our top priority is **compliance with the laws and the regulations of courts and of data protection authorities**. We do not offer options that are not legally or legally highly controversial.

**Why so strict?** Because our users have neither the desire nor the budget to lead complex procedures through all appeals, just to find out whether any cool feature is legally permissible or not.

**But don't worry:** there are never any end features, just scroll down, down, down ... :)

# **LAWYER CREATED**

All legal texts were created by the law firm Marketingrecht.eu, which specializes in IT, internet and data protection law.

**Important note:** This plugin only supports you in fulfilling the guidelines for compliance with the GDPR. Installation is not enough - correct configuration of this plugin by a website administrator is required to achieve conformity. A 100% conformity only through the plugin cannot be guaranteed, as this depends on several other aspects. If you use our plugin and enable integrations with your custom snippets (Google Analytics, FB Pixel, Criteo,...), 3rd party scripts get loaded or remote ressources get called if/after your visitors opt-in for them. An valid statement in the privacy policy (to fulfill GDPR requirements) gets added automatically by this plugin. In some features automatically generated emails get sent to you or your customers. In these emails Google Fonts are used.
